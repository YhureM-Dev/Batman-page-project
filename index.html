            <p><i>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, playboy, business tycoon, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises corporation. After witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, Wayne swore revenge on criminals — an oath tempered by an ideal of justice. Wayne then trains physically and intellectually and creates a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City, aided by his butler Alfred Pennyworth, Police Commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not have superpowers; so, in his war against crime, he uses his genius intellect, his martial arts expertise and his physical dexterity - as well as his wealth, which guarantees him a huge arsenal of weapons and state-of-the-art equipment. A wide variety of villains make up Batman's gallery of enemies, including the Joker, his nemesis.</i></p>
